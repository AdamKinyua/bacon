        <li>Best ways to take a break between study/coding sessions:
          <ul>
            <li>the bed</li> <li>the bath</li> <li>the bus</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Obvious is the most dangerous word in mathematics</li>
        <li>Before you tuck yourself in bed, look at the rules, the essentials of what you are trying to learn. Let them be the last words I repeat to myself before I go to sleep</li>
        <li>Intention to learn is helpful only if it leads to the use of good learning strategies</li>
        <li>Rewrite your notes every evening after the lecture</li>
        <li>Make your knowledge second nature - getting a concept in class and being able to apply it in the real world problem helps differentiate between a normal student and a full brown scientist</li>
        <li>ANKI application is good for learning new materials</li>
